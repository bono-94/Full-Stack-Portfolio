  - Tertiary colors - yellow, red, purple, pink, dark blue are used for game board buttons to represent each ocean animal (color-matching purpose)
- Fonts:
  - Oswald - used as fisherman-like font for main important to read information such as title, pages, footer, rules and similar
  - Titan One - used as bubbly retro contrast to Oswald which is used for all in-game text to change the mode of user from reading to entertaintainment mood
- Layout - besides coloring separation, main page structure can be separated on Website Mode and Game Mode
  - Website Mode - main landing page where user can take their time and explore rules, fill up forms, and follow social media links
  - Game Mode - once user starts the game with inserting a coin, structure is not anymore one long solid html page
    - instead, different smaller sections written in html are constantly exchanging with each other with use of Javascript
    - snappy screen width and height to the users' devices without scrolling to get the feeling of using a gaming app instead a long website page
- Media
  - Custom Media - Professional custom work for the most important visual aspect of game logo, intro video and loading video  
  - Imported Media - Stock images that can fill up mostly backgrounds and the relevant image for the Results Screens

## Testing 

I have conducted enough hours of testing across all screen sizes, devices and different browsers to conclude that now the site works well and all discussed features are included as intended. Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on large PC monitors, average laptops, tablets, and various mobile devices all in different screen sizes with minimum width of 320px for older devices. The website was given to friends and family to test out the website representing different types of users and their browsing styles next to personal backgrounds. All content is readable and understandable styled with good contrasting colors that also visually create a good combination. There is no visual bugs or errors after extensive testing

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org)
  - ![HTML Test](./assets/media/images/testing/html.jpg)

- CSS
  - No errors when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)
  - ![CSS Test](./assets/media/images/testing/css.jpg)

- Jshint
  -  No errors when passing through the official [Jshint validator](https://jshint.com)
  - Metrics returned:
    - There are 68 functions in this file
    - Function with the largest signature take 0 arguments, while the median is 0
    - Largest function has 16 statements in it, while the median is 4
    - The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 13 while the median is 1
  - ![Java Test](./assets/media/images/testing/java.jpg)

- Accessibility
  - This test confirms that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible to users. All scores are satisfactory besides performance since the site uses complex visuals and animation and large media which will be solved with the next update. The only issue found by the Lighthouse is referring to picture sizes, which are not impacting any animation or positioning of additional elements. It causes more taxation on the computing system and increases loading time, but the final results are as coded across all screens. All common practices and SEO levels have passed with a full percentage
  - talk about alt and aria-labels

    ![Lighthouse Results](./assets/media/images/lighthouse.jpg)


PEP8

## Credits 


### Content, Knowledge and Code
  
- All content and code are 100% unique and custom-made per request for a client in order to prevent any legal issues in the future and to provide full control over an optimized experience

- All content, concepts, and visuals have been exclusively created for this site and to solve specific problem for any user without any external inspiration

- Code structure is also 100% original and completely created by a developer. A developer has followed HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python courses at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/) where theory on building blocks has been taught. After reading through knowledge materials to see what are possibilities of creating this site are, general blocks have been put together separately to create original work. Given completed examples have not been plagiarized but served as a general guide from a client for a developer from project examles such as: love-sandwiches and battleships. Finally, the README structure has been used by Code Institute's template and example in this project in order to be created under industry standards and expectations. A general python template for repository created for students before commencing their project for convenience has been imported before the first coding lines. Project requirements have been used as secondary rough guidelines for the content structure. Consultations with Student Care, Tutors, and Personal Mentor Rowan were provided by them as well which was crucial in this project creation by providing support, motivation, and any mistakes indications and guidance to own problem-solving

- All debugging and problem-solving has been done strictly by the developer trying different combinations with known and unknown elements and attributes. No external sources and no professional help just Code Institute's tutors for elaboration on theory and advices dealing with complex problems
 
  - [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) has been used as an additional knowledge course. Reading over the second set and point of view on theory and understanding of elements to seal the Code Institue knowledge and review before writing the project for a full rough draft of the idea

  - [Codepad](https://codepad.co/snippet/button-with-sound-effect) has been used to give Java instructions on how to play sound at a specific place in functions and how to do it. Code was not used directly but as a learning method to understand new concepts. 

        $(document).ready(function() {
    
          var audio  = new Audio('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/click.mp3');
          var audio2 = new Audio('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/242518/clickUp.mp3')

          $(".button").mousedown(function() {
            audio2.load();
            audio2.play();
          });
          
          $(".button").mouseup(function() {
            audio.load();
            audio.play();
          });
        });

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/refresh-the-page-in-javascript-js-reload-window-tutorial/) has been used to learn more about another unknown concept in JavaScript which helped the project to switch from Gaming Mode back to the index Website Mode

      window.location.reload();

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp) has been used to build on the Math.random knowledge from Code Institute by adding minimum and maximum values to each randomly generated numbers

      Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

- [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/learn/github-pages-404) has been used to build custom 404 error page when user tries to access non-existing pages

### Media

  - Every photo and both videos featuring coins or logos are all original works created especially for this site

  - The background photos on all pages that represent nature have been all downloaded from only 2 external sources:
