### Landing Media

  - The landing cover media includes a professional custom-made image
  - This section introduces the user to the Innovation Lamd page with an eye-catching sharp and creative 3D logo
  - This will grab users' attention and increase the chances of a great first impression
  - Without an extensive text introduction requiring serious participation, the image relaxes the user with smooth colors with good contrast bringing users over to the next section that introduces the page.
  - Instead of first reading, then relaxing, we wanted the user to build up the energy instead of dropping it before exploring the rest of the page due to too many textual distractions

#### Agile Development Team Report

In our Agile Development approach, we embraced the principles of Scrum, kanban, flexibility, and continuous improvement. Through iterative development, we broke down our project into manageable user stories, prioritizing and delivering them in short sprints. User involvement was key as we actively seeked and incorporated feedback while conducting regular testing to ensure our features met user needs. With continuous integration and delivery, we seamlessly integrated code changes, run manual tests, and deployed updates to production environments post release during final master testing. Our adaptability shined as we embraced change, refactored code when needed, and maintained a positive innovative mindset throughout. Regular outsider retrospectives allowed us to reflect on our progress, identifying areas for improvement and implementing immediate changes. Transparency and accountability drove us as we tracked progress, every step taken and properly thought about with patience. Documentation was very important, enabling clarity and knowledge sharing through user stories. Finally, we adpoted a culture of continuous learning, encouraging new skillset development and taken extra steps to stay ahead of industry trends. Together, these events guide our Agile Development process, ensuring efficient, collaborative, and high-quality software delivery.

  - What needs to be achieved, not how
  ---

- Ideation:
  - Generating key ideas based on well-defined problem

- Quantum Coloration:
  - Main colors - orange and black which compliment and contrast each other well (structural coloring purpose)
  - Secondary colors - light blue and white are used as separation between content and main colors (organizational coloring purpose)
  - Tertiary colors - grey which comes out as combination of black and white naturally serves as background and space filler in most of the cases(color-matching purpose)
  - The separation between main and secondary color does a significant purpose to the project visually separating content type for user due to a lot of options and visualisations. They can stand separate or next to each other, 4+1 color model has turned out exactly as envisioned, if not even better. Every element has been colored with purpose and in consideration of all other elements

  ![Color Schema](./assets/media/images/design/colorization.jpg)

---
- Fonts:
  - Open Sans - used as a balanced, harmonious style for all larger elements of the page
  - Roboto - used as modern, simple and readable style for all paragraph and text elements 
---

## Testing 

I have conducted infinite hours of testing across all screen sizes, devices and different browsers to conclude that now the site works well and all discussed features are included as intended. Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on large PC monitors, average laptops, tablets, and various mobile devices all in different screen sizes with minimum width of 320px for older devices. The website was given to friends and family to test out the website representing different types of users and their browsing styles next to personal backgrounds. All content is readable and understandable styled with good contrasting colors that also visually create a good combination. There is no visual bugs or errors after extensive testing

- Automatic testing has been left until version 2.0 when it will be of use for specific new features that will benefit of it
- For current project structure and endless hours of manual testing it does not make significant contribution

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org)

### Manual Testing

This project was manually tested with following procedures:

- Code was passed through a PEP8 linter inside gitpod without any errors returned
- Entire website, every input field, every element and button were tested with correct and incorrect inputs in the both gitpod pre-deployment and Heroku post-deployment environments
- Focus on functionality, usability, responsiveness and data management
- CONCLUSION: Production version matched development version without any errors

---

#### Test 1

- Expected:
  - Nav menu bar is expected to take user to different sections of the page when user presses one of the 4 options
  - Title "Bigger Fish" is expected to take user again to the same page
- Testing: 
  - Tested both features by clicking on them and around them
- Result
  - Both features responded as intended by only directly clicking on them, not around them or empty gray space
---

#### Test 2

- Expected:
  - Nav menu bar is expected to take user to different sections of the page when user presses one of the 4 options
  - Title "Bigger Fish" is expected to take user again to the same page

### Bugs

__Unsolved Bugs__

- All bugs were solved
- There were no significant bugs in the development process
- Mostly it was learning curve of new framework so every step of the code there was an error that was solved with learning, persistance and effort
- Sources of knowledge are included below.
- Once fully understood, everything made sense and it was easy to create entire website without distractions and bugs


## Credits 

### Content, Knowledge and Code
  
- All content and code are 100% unique and custom-made per request for a client in order to prevent any legal issues in the future and to provide full control over an optimized experience

- All content, concepts, and visuals have been exclusively created for this site and to solve specific problem for any user without any external inspiration

- Code structure is also 100% original and completely created by a developer. A developer has followed HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python courses at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/) where theory on building blocks has been taught. After reading through knowledge materials to see what are possibilities of creating this site are, general blocks have been put together separately to create original work. Given completed examples have not been plagiarized but served as a general guide. Finally, the README structure has been used by Code Institute's template and example in this project in order to be created under industry standards and expectations. A general django template for repository created for students before commencing their project for convenience has been imported before the first coding lines. Project requirements have been used as secondary rough guidelines for the content structure. Consultations with Student Care, Tutors, and Personal Mentor Rowan were provided by them as well which was crucial in this project creation by providing support, motivation, and any mistakes indications and guidance to own problem-solving. Code Institute, therefore can be referenced also as the main knowledge source tool

- All debugging and problem-solving has been done strictly by the developer trying different combinations with known and unknown elements and attributes. No external sources and no professional help just Code Institute's tutors for elaboration on theory and advices dealing with complex problems

### Direct Elements

- [Code Insitute Blog](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/Django3blog) project has been used as a reference point. The blog post model from here has been adjusted to fit this project's purpose and significantly expanded. Admin, views and URL python files have also been used as a starting point of this project accordingly adjusted, expanded and customized. Template rendering of home page, post list and post details have been used also as inspiration, starting point and foundation, however this has been much more modified to the point that only the code concept has been borrowed after building a lot on top of it. This project would and wouldn’t be possible without Django 3 Blog because it shows the first-time developer what are all required things to take in consideration to build fully functioning app

- [Code Insitute Bootstraping](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/BootstrappingYourNextBigIdea-BS4/tree/master) project has served the purpose of introducing bootstrap language and how to install it and use it properly. Without the knowledge provided how to use bootstrap, Innovation Land project would be still possible, but it would take significantly more time and resources to achieve the same end result with custom CSS rules.  

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_opacity) documentation has been used to find out how to add opacity with navigational box on post lists thumbnail images and create buttons view, edit & delete

- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/) AI code generator has been used to gain first experiences with AI before starting AI university upon completion of this project. Since there was no good source or article to solve my complex problem, I asked AI to write a code for me also to test current advances and to learn how it works. The result is the custom validation code below that it wrote for me for checking validations on 2 input fields that sum of their input must be number 100 to provide users with ratios at strategic place.

  ```
  cleaned_data = super().clean()
        focus_fields = [
            'focus_innovation',
            'focus_financials',
            'focus_planning',
            'focus_monitoring',
            'focus_quality',
            'focus_quantity',
            'focus_collaboration',
            'focus_leadership',
        ]

        total_supply = cleaned_data.get('stocks_quantity_total_supply')
        proposal = cleaned_data.get('stocks_quantity_proposal')
        pos_supply = cleaned_data.get('end_product_or_service_total_supply')
        pos_proposal = cleaned_data.get(
            'end_product_or_service_quantity_proposal'
            )

        focus_values = [cleaned_data.get(field) for field in focus_fields]
        for i in range(0, 8, 2):
            if not all(focus_values[i:i+2]):
                continue
            if sum(focus_values[i:i+2]) != 100:
                msg = f"The sum of {focus_fields[i].split('_', 1)[1]} and " \
                    f"{focus_fields[i+1].split('_', 1)[1]} must be equal " \
                    f"to 100."
                self.add_error(focus_fields[i], msg)
                self.add_error(focus_fields[i+1], msg)

        if total_supply and proposal and proposal > total_supply:
            self.add_error(
                'stocks_quantity_proposal',
                "Quantity proposed can't be higher than the total supply."
                )

        if pos_supply and pos_proposal and pos_proposal > pos_supply:
            self.add_error(
                'end_product_or_service_quantity_proposal',
                "Quantity proposed can't be higher than the total supply."
                )

        return cleaned_data
  ```
